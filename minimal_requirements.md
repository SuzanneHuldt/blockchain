#minimal requirements

1. what are the minimal requirements for building something that can call itself a blockchain?

  a) a ledger
    - some way to store information in a way that:
      * is distributed (ie. exists on different systems at one time)
      * can be updated by users

  b) timestamp presentation (to create 'chain')
    - a way to present historical data, with newest data appended
    * strictly ordered according to timestamp accompanying appended data

  c) a way to sign and seal blocks
    - an agreed function for generating unique hash keys available for all users to seal completed transactions

2. what are the best technologies for us as a team to use to implement these requirements?


3. which of these makes sense to implement first as an MVP?
