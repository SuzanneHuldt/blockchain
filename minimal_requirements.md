# minimal requirements

## A. what are the minimal requirements for building something that can call itself a blockchain?

  1) a ledger

    a) some way to store information in a way that:

    b) is distributed (ie. exists on different systems at one time)

    c) can be updated by users

  2) timestamp presentation (to create 'chain')

    a) a way to present historical data, with newest data appended

    b) strictly ordered according to timestamp accompanying appended data

  3) a way to sign and seal blocks

    a) an agreed function for generating unique hash keys available for all users to seal completed transactions

    BONUS: proof of work - as a way to increase security for sealing blocks 

## B. what are the best technologies for us as a team to use to implement these requirements?


## C. which of these makes sense to implement first as an MVP?
